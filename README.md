# EMC 203 Final Requirement (Ledesma, Mallo)
**Project Overview**
The Balance of Life uses the four playing card symbols—hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades—as metaphors for various aspects of life. Each symbol represents a distinct element: hearts signify emotional fulfillment, diamonds represent material ambition, clubs reflect growth and action, and spades embody challenges and wisdom. These symbols will be showcased together to highlight the harmonious balance required to navigate life effectively.

**Features, Tools, and Libraries**
The project employs Three.js and the Canvas API to create a visually engaging 3D presentation.
Key features include:
- Object Rotation: Each symbol rotates slowly to emphasize its significance and create a dynamic visual effect.
- Lighting Effects: Thoughtfully designed lighting enhances the symbols' textures and colors, making them stand out.
- Modern Rendering Techniques: We integrate animations for a polished, cohesive look.

**Interactivity Instructions**
The presentation will include subtle interactive elements such as a potential UI allowing users to control rotation angles enriching their experience.

This combination of animation, lighting, and interactivity ensures an engaging and immersive experience for the audience.
